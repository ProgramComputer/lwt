# How to Learn

First, find a text you want to study, preferably with an audio file, and load it into LWT. 
The [LingQ Library](http://lingq.com) has many texts with audio, and only a free registration is needed. 
Or look into [Where to find good content to import (LingQ forum)](https://forum.lingq.com/t/where-to-find-good-content-to-import/2563) 
in the LingQ Forum, you will find there lots of great links to resources. 
Or click (within the LingQ library) on "My Imports" - you will find a list of links 
of "Suggested resources".

Read the text, look up the new words and expressions (=terms) and save them for review and test. 
The good thing with LWT: Every saved term will show up with its translation, 
status, etc. in all other occurrences of the same text and every other text! 
So you'll see immediately what you already know and how well you know it. 
And of course you'll see what you don't know!

Train: load the MP3 file also on your portable MP3 player and listen to it often. 
Review (by reading again) or test your saved words and expressions.  

In short:

* Listen ▶ Read ▶ Review/Test.  
* Listen ▶ Read ▶ Review/Test.  
* ......  

That's it. It's that simple. You can also watch

"The 7 secrets of language learning", "Language learning FAQ", and many more to learn more eficiently.
